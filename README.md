<h1>Disco Centric Website</h1>

One of my recent jobs was to completely redesign and deploy
a new online prescence for Cardiff function band, Disco
Centric. This included choosing colour schemes, styling,
fonts, all image design and writing full code from scratch.
<br />
<br />
SASS was used to compile the CSS, variables were used for
colours and styling and each section was deployed in its own
file. I used Bootstrap for a basic outline parameter e.g.
for container classes and the grid system.
<br />
<br />
The homepage navigation sees the nav items (on click) scroll
through various sections, while the secondary nav (present
on all other pages) redirects to other individual pages.
<br />
<br />
JavaScript was deployed on the navigation menu (background
to only show on scroll), accordions for the FAQ and Song
Lists, as well as the instagram gallery and testimonial
carousel. <br />
<br />
PHP was used on the contact forms for clients to succesfully
send messages to the recipent's email address. <br /><br />
GIMP and Pixlr were used to edit images.
